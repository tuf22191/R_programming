Hey guys,

      This is just some stuff I am doing (Summer 2016) pertaining to scraping Twitter data. 
I am using the R programming language, and have used somebody else's Github package for API calls
to Twitter their profile <- https://github.com/joyofdata/RTwitterAPI . Install their package for good API calls!!

You can look at some of my code to see how I implemented things with the data frames.I know, I did a poor job of documentation 
and what not. If you have any questions please email me at tuf22191 (at) Temple (dot) edu !!!

      Alicode.R was written by a fellow worker of mine who knows R more than I do. At the time I was very much new to the R 
programming language and I still am. I have not used any of the statistical tools, just the data acquisition of Twitter Data. 
So, the stuff you see here is VERY MUCH A COLLECTIVE EFFORT AND NOT JUST MY OWN WORK! Like all of the code I wrote is based 
off of the Alicode.R file that my fellow worker wrote for me!
